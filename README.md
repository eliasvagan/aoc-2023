# Advent of Code 2023 solutions

> I'm using typescript in node to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)


## Initial setup
Install dependencies w/[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or equivalent)
```bash
# In the repo's root dir:
npm i
```

## Run solutions

1. Add your inputs to files in `/inputs`, e.g. `inputs/inp01.txt`. 
2. Solve the tasks using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or some other js runtime)

```bash
npm run solve-01-a # Day 1 task A
npm run solve-01-b # Day 1 task B
npm run solve-02-a # Day 2 task A
npm run solve-02-b # Day 2 task B
# etc...
```

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure the `run` scripts in `package.json` point to the right files.
- Run tests with `npm run test` to verify the solution's integrity.
