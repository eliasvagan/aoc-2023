# Advent of Code 2023

> I'm using typescript in node to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)


## Initial setup

```bash
# In the repo's root dir:
npm i
```

## Run solutions
Solve the tasks using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or some other js runtime)

```bash
npm run <task>
```

... in which `<task>` is one of the following:
- `solve-01-a`
- `solve-01-b`
