# Advent of Code 2023 solutions

> I'm using typescript in node to solve the challenges from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)


## Initial setup

```bash
# In the repo's root dir:
npm i
```

## Run solutions
Solve the tasks using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or some other js runtime)

```bash
npm run solve-01-a # Day 1 task A
npm run solve-01-b # Day 1 task B
npm run solve-02-a # Day 2 task A
npm run solve-02-b # Day 2 task B
# etc...
```

Input data can be changed in `/inputs`. The files are passed into their respective tasks in `package.json` `run` scripts.
